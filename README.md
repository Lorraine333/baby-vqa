Some (baby) Keras deep neural networks for the Visual Question Answering task.

These are some experiments we did for the final term project of [Compsci697L-Deep Learning](http://compsci697l.github.io). We tried different deep leraning architectures for Visual Question Answering task and you are more than welcome to join us on this fun problem!
